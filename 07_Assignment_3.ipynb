    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to recognize objects in images of realistic scenes. There are 19 different classes of object e.g. person, dog, cat, car, etc. The dataset derives from several thousands photographs harvested from the web. Each object of a relevant class has been manually annotated with a bounding box. Images can contain none, one or multiple objects of each class. We have prepared a [website](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/2014/assts/asst3/images.html) where you can view the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to detect whether images contain a person or not - a binary classification problem. To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we have preprocessed the dataset. We will use the [Bag of Visual Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision) representation. Each column of the dataset (which is not an lable), refers to a 'visual word'. Each image is represented by a 500 dimensional vector that contains the normalized count for each of 500 different visual words present in the respective image (a similar representation is used for the spambase dataset, just for real words). See the Appendix at the bottom of the notebook for more information. The image data is thus a $N \\times 500$ dimensional matrix where `N` is the number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset has 520 attributes (dimensions). The first attribute (`imgID`) contains the image ID which allows you to associate a data point with an actual image. The next 500 attributes (`dim1`, ..., `dim500`) are a normalized count vector for each visual word. The last 19 attributes (`is_class`) are the labels - 1 means the class is present in the image. In most of the experiments (unless explicitly noted otherwise) you will only need the `is_person` attribute and the 500 dimensional feature vector. **Do not use the additional class indicator attributes as features** unless explicitly told to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part A we provide you with a training (`train_images partA.csv`) and a validation (`valid_images partA .csv`) dataset. In Part B we provide three data sets: a training set (`train_images partB.csv`), a validation set (`valid_images partB.csv`), and a test set (`test_images partB.csv`). The training and validation set contain valid labels. In the test set the labels are missing. The files are available from the GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: *Throughout the assignment you will be given various versions of the dataset that are relevant\n",
    "to a particular question. Please be careful to use the correct version of the dataset when instructed to do so.\n",
    "If you use the wrong version of the dataset by mistake no marks will be awarded.*"

To estimate this metric you will need to evaluate probability outputs, as opposed to discrete predictions which we have used so far to compute classification accuracies. Most models in `sklearn` implement a `predict_proba()` method which returns the probabilities for each class.

    "Visual words are based on [Scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). SIFT features are essentially local orientation histograms and capture the properties of small image regions. They possess attractive invariance properties which make them well suited for our task (you can read more about SIFT features in [D.Lowe, IJCV 60(2):91- 110, 2004](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94), but the details don't matter for the purpose of this assignment). Each SIFT feature is a 128 dimensional vector. From each image many SIFT features are extracted, typically > 2500 per image (features are extracted at regular intervals using a 15 pixel grid and at 4 different scales). To obtain visual words a representative subset of all extracted SIFT features from all images is chosen and clustered with k-means using 500 centres (such use of the k-means algorithm will be discussed in detail during the lecture). These 500 cluster centres form our visual words. The representation of a single image is obtained by first assigning each SIFT feature extracted from the image to the appropriate cluster (i.e. we determine the visual word corresponding to each feature by picking the closest cluster centre). We then count the number of features from that image assigned to each cluster (i.e. we determine how often each visual word is present in the image). This results in a 500 dimensional count vector for each image (one dimension for each visual word). The normalized version of this count vector gives the final representation of the image (normalized means that we divide the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image)"
